# BVM_Ventilator
Motor powered BVM ventilator, our contribution to the Open Source COVID19 Medical Supplies and Code Life Ventilator Challenge. 
Goal is to make two versions, one that is very low tech for remote locations, resource deprived, or emergency situations. 
The other that is still simple but more useful with access to better tech.
